# Smart Bird’s Nest  

A compact and eco-friendly IoT-based bird monitoring system designed to study birds’ behavior in their natural habitats without causing disturbances. This project integrates sensors, a Raspberry Pi, and AI-based bird species recognition to provide real-time insights into bird activities, environmental data, and species identification.

## Features  
- **Non-Intrusive Monitoring**: Fits BirdLife Suomi Ry's smallest birdhouse dimensions to minimize disturbances.  
- **Real-Time Data Collection**: Streams audio, video, and environmental data such as temperature, humidity, motion, and light levels.  
- **AI Bird Species Recognition**: Utilizes BirdNet AI to classify bird species from audio recordings.  
- **Eco-Friendly Power**: Operates on solar energy for sustainable use.  
- **Educational and Conservation Tool**: Supports wildlife research, conservation, and student learning about nature.

## Hardware Components  
- **Raspberry Pi 4B**: Core of the system for data processing and communication.  
- **Motion Sensor (HC-SR505)**: Detects movements inside the bird’s nest.  
- **Light Sensor (Adafruit BH1750)**: Monitors light levels to toggle IR LEDs for night vision.  
- **Temperature and Humidity Sensor (DHT22)**: Tracks environmental conditions.  
- **Camera Module (Raspberry Pi Camera Module 2 NoIR)**: Captures high-resolution images and videos with infrared capabilities.  
- **Microphone (MI-305)**: Records audio for bird species recognition.  
- **Solar Panel and Battery System**: Provides sustainable power supply.

## Software Stack  
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Web Framework**: Flask  
- **Video Streaming**: MJPEG-based real-time streaming via HTTP.  
- **AI Model**: BirdNet for bird species recognition.

## System Architecture  
1. **Data Collection**: Sensors gather environmental data, and the camera/microphone captures video and audio when motion is detected.  
2. **Data Processing**: Raspberry Pi processes sensor readings and streams data through the Flask server.  
3. **AI Recognition**: BirdNet analyzes recorded audio to classify bird species with confidence levels.  
4. **Data Storage**: Captured images and bird species data are stored in an SQLite3 database.
